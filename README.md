# C570_4_FUN
Repo for COMPE570 coursework done for fun (okay well, kinda fun) over summer.  
  
# Tooling
As best as possible no proprietary or closed source tools  
will be used unless otherwise noted.  
All builds target the iCE40-UP5k via Apio/Project Icestorm. 
The Upduino 3.1 development board is used for real implementations.
GTK Wave used for simulations. VCD files not provided, testbenches are.  
  
GNU Octave 8.2.0 with Instrumentation Control 0.8.0 used  
instead of Matlab for USB Serial interface and math handling.
